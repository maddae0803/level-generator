For my Winter Term Project, I developed an Android application for the Du Bois Project is a local math club in Oberlin, Ohio, aimed towards helping underrepresented minority students and low income students in Oberlin Public Schools refine and develop their math skills. In addition to music and physical games, the Du Bois Project uses several Android apps to make learning math more exciting for the students (referred to as “mathletes”), and uses NFC chips and the Amazon Simple Database to keep track of each student’s progress. The goal of my mobile app was to help coaches (tutors) keep track of each student's progress on each math game/activity by analyzing the data from the simpleDB as well as each mathlete’s NFC chip. Based on what level a mathlete is currently on and how long it has been since the mathlete had last gained a level, coaches would be able to track what level of a certain activity a mathlete should be given next. The app is also able to store data in the simpleDB.
